- ## Find All Factorial numbers <= N
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-all-factorial-numbers-less-than-or-equal-to-n3548/0 \
    ```I used recursion to calculate the factorial of different values starting from 1 and check if it's less than or equal to N or not, it limit exceeds then i return the function and print the result.```

- ## Fibonacci Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/description/ \
    ```I used recursion, in which i used n=1 & n=2 as base case and returned n, else i called the function recursively with n-1 and n-2.```

- ## Valid Palindrome
    https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/ \
    ```I used recursion to check palindrome, using reverse an array logic (by checking first and last element and so on) and then before checking for palindrome i remove non-alpha numeric characters and convert the string to lower case.```

- ## Subsets
    https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/ \
    ```I used recursion to find the subsets, in which i used take & don't take technique, in which i take the element and call the function recursively with index+1 and take the element and don't take the element and call the function recursively with index+1 & if index greater than or equal to the size of the array then i print the subset. That's how i find all the subsets.```
